# Welcome to our new website
If you are a returning visit to our site, you will see many changes.

The first change you will see is a new layout that is a result of the move to Ramaze language.

If you are not familiar with Ramaze, you can find more information at [Ramaze web site](http://ramaze.net).

Another change that you will discover is the use of Google docs spreadsheets to store the results of the weekly production analysis.

The Google spreadsheets provide more capabilities including visitor mapping and additional pivot analysis.

Here is a sample map that is available with the Google tool.
